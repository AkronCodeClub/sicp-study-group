Exercise 1.11 (Recursive and Iterative Fibonacci function)

Test_FIB_1_11.EXE is a compiled unit test program for fib_1_11.pas.  The test cases are defined in testcase_fib.pas.

The open source pascal compiler, Lazarus, was used to write this program.  This compiler is found at http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/ and is available for Windows, OS X, and Linux.

Execute the unit test by calling Test_Fib.cmd.

The code is very simple, I just wanted to play around with Lazarus.
