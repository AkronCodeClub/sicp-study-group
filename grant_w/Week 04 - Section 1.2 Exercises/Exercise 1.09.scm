; 1.9 - Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc,
;         which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.
;       Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5).
;       Are these processes iterative or recursive?
